# Temp Permission List

The Temp Permission List defines all available temporary permissions that can be granted to a player using the `AddTempPermission` export in Sentinel-AC.

These permissions allow administrators or developers to temporarily bypass specific anti-cheat modules or enable special functions for testing, debugging, or trusted staff operations. Temporary permissions are automatically revoked when the player disconnects or the server restarts.

Each permission corresponds to a module or feature inside Sentinel-AC.

## How It Works

**Give a temporary permission:**
```lua
exports["sentinel-ac"]:AddTempPermission(playerId, "sentinel.module_name", true)
````

**Remove a temporary permission:**

```lua
exports["sentinel-ac"]:AddTempPermission(playerId, "sentinel.module_name", false)
```
