# Installation

Follow these steps to install and configure **Sentinel-AC** on your FiveM server.

---

## 1. Download the Required Files

Make sure to download all the necessary dependencies before installation.

**Required Resource:**
- [screenshot-basic](https://github.com/project-error/screenshot-basic/releases/download/1.0.1/screenshot-basic.zip)

Place the downloaded resource inside your server’s `resources` folder.

---

## 2. Add Immunity Permissions to `server.cfg`

To ensure staff members have immunity in Sentinel-AC, add the following lines to your `server.cfg` file:

```cfg
add_ace group.developer sentinel.immune allow
add_ace group.superadmin sentinel.immune allow
add_ace group.admin sentinel.immune allow
add_ace group.moderator sentinel.immune allow
````

This grants immunity to staff roles, preventing them from being affected by Sentinel-AC’s automatic actions.

## 3. Enabling the Built-in Admin Menu

If you’d like to use Sentinel-AC’s built-in admin menu, add the following permissions to your `server.cfg`:

```cfg
add_ace group.developer sentinel.menu.clear_vehicles allow
add_ace group.developer sentinel.menu.clear_peds allow
add_ace group.developer sentinel.menu.clear_objects allow
add_ace group.developer sentinel.menu.clear_all allow
```

These permissions allow staff/developers to use the admin menu to clear vehicles, peds, objects, or all entities directly from the menu.

> ⚙️ **Note:** More admin menu permissions will be added in future updates.

---

Once done, restart your server and enjoy Sentinel-AC’s protection and admin tools.
